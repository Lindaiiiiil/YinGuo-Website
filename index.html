        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an University of California, Riverside student. Also, I am an international student. My first language is Chinese. I can communicate better and more freely with Chinese customers. I also understand the needs and hobbies of Chinese customers better. I have participated in volunteer activities. Help local young people with disabilities. I visited every family of disabled teenagers, communicated with them and their parents, wrote down the problems they are currently facing, compiled the summary report and submitted it to relevant government agencies. In the end, the team led by me won the excellent group award for this volunteer activity. 2 years of work experience in copywriting planning. I admire the power of words, have a reading habit, and have a writing ability above the average level. Long and short essays and writing styles can be changed to meet a variety of requirements. Like to receive information from different fields and different media, the ability to get in touch with new things is relatively quick. Strong ability to withstand pressure, strong sense of teamwork, able to endure hardships, full of enthusiasm for life, and care about real experience.
Friendly, sincere, meticulous, dedicated, strong sense of responsibility, strong learning ability and adaptability, like to communicate with others, love life. The traits of being calm, good at thinking and researching. As an undergraduate student of a business major, he has been accompanied by writing for many years and has a solid foundation in writing. Strong ability in text editing and planning.<br><br>

        Proficiency in word, Excel, powerpoint. I used to work as a text editor at CSSA and published some public articles, which attracted the attention of many people. I work as a counselor in an after-school training class. The students in my class love my teaching mode very much, and I have been rated as an "excellent counselor". At the same time, I am also deeply recognized and supported by the parents of the students. I once did an event matchmaking in a chamber of commerce, and ensured that the information and time of the invited persons for this event did not have any problems throughout the event. In addition, I also received additional cash from this company. I used to do text editing and photography in a media company. At the same time, I also went out several times to assist the company in organizing events.<br><br>

        I have participated in volunteer activities. Help local young people with disabilities. I visited every family of disabled teenagers, communicated with them and their parents, wrote down the problems they are currently facing, compiled the summary report and submitted it to relevant government agencies. In the end, the team led by me won the excellent group award for this volunteer activity. I am particularly keen to participate in different volunteer activities, just to learn more about different lives and help people in need. Putting limited energy and time into infinite space is what I often say to myself. I think "There is nothing difficult in the world, as long as you are willing to climb." When facing difficulties, I will do my best to overcome all of this and will never shrink back. Only by resolving these difficulties can the level of life be improved.
